This web application is an unsophisticated implementation of a "Wall of Sheep" that I created for http://uga.edu/chugalug/meetings/2011-08-18.php

It was tested with python 2.7, tornado 2.1, and dsniff 2.4. It requires a web browser, such as Chromium, that supports the websocket protocol.

The interface to sniff traffic on and the port to diplay the application on are configurable in wos.ini

You must configure /etc/sudoers to allow running dsniff without a password. This should look like "user_running_wos ALL = (root) NOPASSWD:/usr/sbin/dsniff"
